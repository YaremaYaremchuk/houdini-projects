# My Old Houdini Projects
A compilation of my old Houdini project and my thoughts about them that I created during 2-3 years ago during Covid Pandemic.

Join me as I am having a nostalgic journey through four captivating Houdini projects from the archives. Each project is a little showcase of the innovation and magic that this powerful procedural 3D software Houdini holds.

# Alien Donut: 
This is one of my first Houdini projects, where I used its complex node system to create something like a donut. <br />
With the help of noise, extrude and polyreduce nodes I was able to create such simple, but at the same time alien-like look.<br /> 
For the render I used Houdini Matra, as at the time I only had windows laptop, without any sufficient GPU for the use of OctaneRender or such.<br />

# Dissolving Pig: 
Houdini is most known for its FX capabilities, specifically explosion, water simulation, destruction physics and **fire**. <br />
I followed one of the popular tutorials on youtube about creating smoke effect, but I tried to expand it and give it more dynamics, which resulted in this quick simulation. <br />
*Houdini shows you what real magic looks like*<br />

# "Procedural Wonders: 
At some point any of us heard about procedural generation in games and most of them are done through Houdini. It has a great set of tools for creating any type of terrains, locations or cities. I tried my shot at the skyscrappers and even tho it's not very colourful or interesting, I learn a lot from it.
